STI Playground for Sass and HTML
================================

More stuff coming. Testing out ideas for style guides.
[This repo can be viewed online](http://sportstech.github.io/sti-sass-and-html-playground).

Goal is to determine best practices for developing common front-end items like:

* Components
  * Countdown Clocks
  * Icons
  * Social Share Buttons
  * Entry Bars
  * Navigation
* UI Elements
  * Buttons
  * Form Elements
  * Layout Containers (flex or no flex?)
  * Modals
  * Tabs
  * Tabular Data (Think Leagues and Leaderboards)
  * Typography
  * Images (Hi-Res)
* Animation
  * `will-change`
* Performance

... More to come.
